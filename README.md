# Overview
Founded in 2018, Somico launched its mobile app and website to sell popular electronic products worldwide. The company has gathered a significant amount of data that has not been fully utilized to maximize sales growth and marketing efficiency and enhance its product offerings and loyalty program. The purpose of this project is to thoroughly analyze and synthesize this data to uncover crucial insights that will improve Somico's commercial success in the future.

# Deep-dive Insights

### Sales Trends
Between 2019 and 2022, we received 108,000 orders and generated $28 million in revenue, both of which increased by 28%. In 2020, sales surged by more than $6 million during the onset of the pandemic as consumer purchasing patterns shifted sharply toward online shopping. However, despite this growth, sales declined by 46% in 2021 and 2022, alongside a 10% decrease in average order value and a 40% drop in order count. To achieve sustainable long-term growth, it is essential to find ways to maintain the value captured during 2020 and 2021.

### Seasonality
Every year, Somico experiences a surge in holiday sales during November (18% increase) and December (23% increase). Additionally, sales see a rebound in March, rising by approximately 18% month-over-month, following sharp declines in February. February and October are the weakest months for sales, with an average decrease of 27%. The sales trends at Somico align with common seasonal patterns observed in electronics companies, while also reflecting consumer behavior. Customers often think that the best deals appear during the holiday season. Consequently, shoppers in October may be waiting for the "deal season" to start in November or are searching for deals elsewhere.

### Product Trends
Apple AirPods constitute a significant portion of Somico's orders, accounting for 45% (over 45,000 units). The company's highest revenue generator is the 27-inch 4K Gaming Monitor, which contributes nearly $10 million, representing 35% of total sales. When combined, the MacBook Air and ThinkPad laptops are estimated to generate 96% of revenue alongside the Gaming Monitors and AirPods. To strengthen its market presence, Somico should prioritize marketing these four key products—AirPods, the Gaming Monitor, MacBook Air, and ThinkPad—over its other offerings.

### Loyalty Program
The loyalty program could serve as an effective way to maintain some of the growth value gained during the boom of 2020. Customers began to adopt the platform in significant numbers starting in early 2021, after its rollout in 2019. By 2021, loyalty customers comprised a larger share of sales and orders compared to non-loyalty customers. Additionally, by 2022, the average order value (AOV) for loyalty customers also surpassed that of non-loyalty customers. 

In direct marketing, the highest number of program sign-ups reached 23,500, resulting in a 40% sign-up rate. Email marketing has proven to be particularly effective, with the highest average sign-up rate of 59%. Analyzing the loyalty program and understanding what consumers value and enjoy most will provide Somico with insights on how to expand and enhance the program.
