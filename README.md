### Seasonality
- **Holiday Sales Surge:**  
  - Somico experiences a significant increase in sales during the holiday season, with an 18% rise in November and a 23% rise in December. These months benefit from heightened consumer demand, driven by holiday shopping and the perception of better deals.
